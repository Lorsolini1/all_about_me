# About Me

"About Me" is an individual in-class project that was done in our cohort at Wyncode Academy. It consists of 2 web pages: A "Home" page that provides a brief introduction to the student and their preferred programming languages, and a "Contact Me" page that provides a form used to contact the student.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account
2. Install the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and use it to install Git (version control system) onto your personal computer. Type the following command in your terminal:
* ```brew install git```

## Installing

 1. The location of the project is https://github.com/Lorsolini1/all_about_me. Go to the page and click the **Fork** button at the top right. Once the forking animation is complete, you will have a copy of the project on your personal Github account.

 2. Copy your fork's HTTP URL from the address bar in your browser (this is the address of your fork on Github's servers).

 3. Clone your forked repository onto your personal computer. Type the following command in your terminal:
 * ```git clone <URLFROMGITHUB>```

 4. Go into the folder for your local copy of the fork. Type the following command in your terminal:
 * ```cd <FORKED REPOSITORY NAME>```

 5. Add a remote connection to the original Github repository in order to pull in changes made to its master branch. Type the following command(s) in your terminal:
 * ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Lorsolini1/all_about_me.git```
 * ```git pull```
